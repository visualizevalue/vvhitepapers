# Gas Wars Whitepaper

## Abstract

Gas Wars is a networked generative artwork that explores the concept of Survivorship Bias through 500 combat simulations on the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Inspired by statistician Abraham Wald's World War II analysis of aircraft damage patterns, the project creates an economic and algorithmic system where destruction contains more information than survival. Each simulation represents the cost per bullet fired at an aircraft, with prices ranging linearly from $0 to $499. The work examines how economic incentives, network congestion, and collector behavior create their own forms of survivorship bias, while generating aircraft that may emerge damaged, destroyed, or absent entirely based on the number of bullets they face.

## Introduction

Gas Wars represents a sophisticated synthesis of historical analysis, economic theory, generative art, and blockchain technology. By translating Abraham Wald's World War II survivorship bias research into a contemporary digital art context, the project creates a system where economic incentives directly influence both artistic outcomes and collector behavior.

The work operates on multiple conceptual levels: as generative art that creates unique aircraft simulations, as economic experiment that tests collector psychology, as technical demonstration of blockchain network dynamics, and as philosophical inquiry into the nature of information, survival, and value attribution in digital systems.

## Historical Foundation: Abraham Wald & Survivorship Bias

### The Original Analysis

During World War II, statistician Abraham Wald was tasked with analyzing damage patterns on aircraft returning from combat missions. Military officials initially wanted to add armor to the areas showing the most bullet holes, reasoning that these were the most frequently hit locations.

Wald's crucial insight inverted this logic: the bullet holes in returning aircraft showed where planes could survive damage, not where they needed protection. The areas without bullet holes were actually the most critical—aircraft hit in these locations never made it back to be analyzed.

**The missing planes told the real story.**

### Survivorship Bias Defined

Survivorship bias occurs when we focus on successful outcomes while overlooking failures, leading to false conclusions about what causes success. In Wald's case:

- **Visible Data**: Damaged but surviving aircraft
- **Invisible Data**: Aircraft that were shot down
- **False Conclusion**: Armor the areas with visible damage
- **Correct Conclusion**: Armor the areas without visible damage

This cognitive bias affects numerous fields: business analysis, medical research, historical records, and investment strategies all suffer from overemphasizing survivors while ignoring failures.

### Contemporary Relevance

Gas Wars translates this historical insight into contemporary digital contexts:

- **Blockchain Networks**: Successful transactions are visible; failed transactions often go unrecorded
- **NFT Markets**: Successful projects receive attention; failed projects disappear from view
- **Generative Art**: Collected pieces are preserved; uncollected pieces may be forgotten
- **Economic Systems**: Profitable strategies are studied; unprofitable ones are ignored

## Conceptual Framework

### Destruction as Information

The project's central thesis—"Destruction contains more information than survival"—inverts conventional value systems. In Gas Wars:

**Low-Price Simulations (Early Numbers)**:
- Face fewer bullets
- Higher survival probability
- Less information about vulnerability patterns
- Greater collector appeal (perceived safety)

**High-Price Simulations (Late Numbers)**:
- Face hundreds of bullets
- Lower survival probability
- Rich data about destruction patterns
- Lower collector appeal (perceived risk)

This creates a paradox: the most expensive and informative pieces are least likely to survive, while the cheapest and least informative pieces have the best survival odds.

### Economic Survivorship Bias

Gas Wars creates its own survivorship bias through economic mechanics:

1. **Collector Behavior**: Rational actors may prefer low-priced, high-survival simulations
2. **Market Dynamics**: High-information, low-survival pieces may remain uncollected
3. **Network Effects**: Gas wars (network congestion) may prevent access to desired pieces
4. **Information Asymmetry**: Expensive pieces contain more data but appeal to fewer collectors

### The Missing Data Problem

Just as Wald's analysis required considering absent aircraft, Gas Wars forces consideration of:

- **Uncollected Simulations**: What information do they contain?
- **Destroyed Aircraft**: What vulnerability patterns do they reveal?
- **Failed Transactions**: How does network congestion affect outcomes?
- **Collector Avoidance**: Why do high-information pieces remain unclaimed?

## Economic Mechanics

### Linear Pricing Model

The pricing structure creates direct correlation between cost and simulation intensity:

| Simulation | Price | Bullets | Survival Odds | Information Value |
|------------|-------|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| #0         | $0    | 0       | 100%          | Minimal           |
| #100       | $100  | 100     | High          | Moderate          |
| #250       | $250  | 250     | Medium        | High              |
| #499       | $499  | 499     | Low           | Maximum           |

### Economic Incentives

**For Low-Price Collectors**:
- Lower financial risk
- Higher survival probability
- Reduced information content
- Greater market appeal

**For High-Price Collectors**:
- Higher financial risk
- Lower survival probability
- Maximum information content
- Potential market inefficiency opportunity

### Network Congestion Economics

The 500-second distribution window may trigger "gas wars"—periods of network congestion where:

- Transaction fees spike dramatically
- Collectors compete for block inclusion
- Some transactions fail due to insufficient gas
- Network dynamics influence artistic outcomes

This meta-layer adds another dimension of survivorship bias: only transactions that survive network congestion successfully mint tokens.

## Algorithmic Generation

### Combat Simulation Algorithm

Each simulation generates unique aircraft through algorithmic processes:

1. **Bullet Generation**: Number of bullets determined by simulation number
2. **Impact Calculation**: Algorithmic determination of hit locations
3. **Damage Assessment**: Evaluation of aircraft survivability
4. **Visual Rendering**: Generation of damaged, destroyed, or absent aircraft
5. **Metadata Creation**: Recording of simulation parameters and outcomes

### Outcome Categories

**Damaged Aircraft**: Survive with visible bullet holes (like Wald's returning planes)
**Destroyed Aircraft**: Catastrophic damage preventing survival
**Absent Aircraft**: Complete destruction leaving no visual trace

### Visual Modes

**Light Mode**: Standard presentation showing aircraft and damage patterns
**Dark Mode**: Alternative visualization emphasizing different aspects of destruction

The dual-mode presentation allows collectors to examine their simulations from multiple perspectives, potentially revealing different information about damage patterns.

### Information Density

Higher-numbered simulations provide richer datasets:

- More bullet impact points
- Complex damage patterns
- Detailed vulnerability analysis
- Comprehensive destruction data

This information density makes expensive simulations valuable for analysis even when aircraft don't survive.

## Network Dynamics & Gas Wars

### Historical Context

Early Art Blocks Curated releases frequently triggered "gas wars"—periods of extreme network congestion where:

- Collectors competed for limited mint opportunities
- Gas prices spiked to hundreds of dollars per transaction
- Network became unusable for normal operations
- Only highest-paying transactions succeeded

### Gas Wars as Artistic Medium

Gas Wars deliberately invokes this phenomenon as part of its conceptual framework:

**Technical Layer**: Network congestion affects who can successfully mint
**Economic Layer**: Gas prices become additional cost beyond artwork price
**Social Layer**: Community coordination and competition dynamics
**Artistic Layer**: Network behavior becomes part of the artwork's meaning

### Survivorship Through Network Dynamics

The 500-second window creates multiple layers of survivorship bias:

1. **Speed Bias**: Fast actors have advantages over slow ones
2. **Economic Bias**: Wealthy collectors can pay higher gas fees
3. **Technical Bias**: Sophisticated users with better tools succeed more often
4. **Network Bias**: Transactions during low-congestion moments have better odds

## Collector Psychology & Market Behavior

### Risk Assessment Patterns

Gas Wars tests how collectors evaluate risk across multiple dimensions:

**Financial Risk**: Higher simulation numbers cost more
**Survival Risk**: Higher numbers have lower survival odds
**Information Risk**: Higher numbers provide more data but less appealing outcomes
**Network Risk**: Gas wars may prevent successful minting

### Behavioral Predictions

**Risk-Averse Collectors**: May cluster around low-numbered simulations
**Information Seekers**: May target high-numbered simulations despite poor survival odds
**Arbitrage Hunters**: May identify mispriced high-information pieces
**Network Gamers**: May use sophisticated tools to navigate gas wars

### Market Inefficiencies

The project may create several market inefficiencies:

- **Information Discount**: High-information pieces trading below intrinsic value
- **Survival Premium**: Low-risk pieces trading above fair value
- **Network Premium**: Successfully minted pieces gaining value from scarcity
- **Completion Premium**: Full collection assembly becoming increasingly difficult

## Philosophical Implications

### Information Theory and Value

Gas Wars challenges conventional relationships between information and value:

**Traditional Model**: More information = Higher value
**Gas Wars Model**: More information = Lower survival odds = Potential lower demand

This inversion forces reconsideration of how we value information, particularly when that information describes failure or destruction.

### The Epistemology of Absence

The project explores what we can learn from what's missing:

- **Absent Aircraft**: What do completely destroyed simulations tell us?
- **Uncollected Pieces**: What does collector avoidance reveal?
- **Failed Transactions**: How does network failure inform our understanding?
- **Invisible Data**: What patterns exist in the spaces between visible outcomes?

### Survivorship Bias in Digital Systems

Gas Wars demonstrates how survivorship bias operates in contemporary digital contexts:

**Blockchain Records**: Only successful transactions are permanently recorded
**NFT Markets**: Only collected pieces receive ongoing attention
**Network Analysis**: Failed transactions often disappear from standard metrics
**Cultural Memory**: Unsuccessful projects fade from collective awareness

### The Value of Destruction

By positioning destruction as information-rich, Gas Wars questions fundamental assumptions about value creation:

- Can failure be more valuable than success?
- Does destruction contain unique insights unavailable through survival?
- How do we preserve and value information about what doesn't work?
- What can we learn from systematic analysis of failure patterns?

## Conclusion

Gas Wars represents a sophisticated synthesis of historical analysis, economic theory, generative art, and blockchain technology. By translating Abraham Wald's World War II survivorship bias research into a contemporary digital art context, the project creates a multi-layered exploration of information, value, and survival in digital systems.

The work's significance extends beyond its immediate aesthetic and economic impact. It demonstrates how generative art can engage seriously with historical precedent, statistical analysis, and behavioral economics while creating genuinely novel artistic experiences. The project's integration of network dynamics, collector psychology, and algorithmic generation creates a complex system where multiple forms of survivorship bias operate simultaneously.

Most importantly, Gas Wars suggests that the most valuable information may often be found in what's missing, destroyed, or overlooked. By creating economic incentives that potentially leave the most information-rich pieces uncollected, the project forces consideration of how we value knowledge, particularly knowledge about failure and destruction.

The work contributes to an emerging paradigm where generative art functions not merely as aesthetic creation but as experimental system for testing economic, psychological, and social theories. This approach positions digital art as a legitimate medium for serious intellectual inquiry while maintaining the visual and conceptual sophistication expected of contemporary art practice.

**The final insight**: In systems where survival and success receive disproportionate attention, the greatest opportunities for learning—and potentially for value creation—may lie in systematic analysis of what fails, what's destroyed, and what never makes it back to tell its story.
