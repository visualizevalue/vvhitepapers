# Visualize Value Whitepapers

A collection of documentation and whitepapers for Visualize Value projects.

## Projects

### Philosophical Foundations

#### VV 1.0
A philosophical framework for understanding and communicating complex ideas through radical simplicity, exploring the power of constraints and visual thinking.

**[Read the VV 1.0 Whitepaper](./projects/VV_1.0.md)**

#### VV 2.0
The evolution of Visualize Value's foundational philosophy into blockchain-based art and digital ownership, demonstrating how cryptographic verification can serve as a new medium for artistic expression.

### Blockchain Artworks

#### Checks
A generative art protocol exploring emergent value creation through participant-driven scarcity mechanisms and on-chain compositing architecture.

**[Read the Checks Whitepaper](./projects/CHECKS.md)**

#### Black Check ($BLKCHK)
An experimental ERC20 token backed by Checks Originals NFTs, exploring themes of fungibility, collective creation, and on-chain art.

**[Read the Black Check Whitepaper](./projects/BLACK_CHECK.md)**

#### Gas Wars
A networked generative artwork exploring survivorship bias through 500 combat simulations on the Ethereum Virtual Machine, inspired by Abraham Wald's World War II analysis.

**[Read the Gas Wars Whitepaper](./projects/GAS_WARS.md)**

#### Full Set
A networked artwork transforming mass-market mechanics into collective value creation, where 27 distinct pieces can become a single statement through consensus mechanisms.

**[Read the Full Set Whitepaper](./projects/FULL_SET.md)**

#### 1 of 1 of ?
An experimental artwork exploring the paradox of artificial scarcity through the simultaneous sale of the same piece as both a unique 1-of-1 and an open edition.

**[Read the 1 of 1 of ? Whitepaper](./projects/1_OF_1_OF.md)**

#### Lemonade Stand
An artwork that emerged from an accidental token launch, transforming an unintended billion-supply ERC-20 coin into a nine-piece exploration of permissionless commerce.

### Hybrid Physical-Digital Works

#### Latent
An experimental artwork exploring the intersection of AI-generated imagery and traditional photography, comprising 80 unique works existing as both digital negatives on Ethereum and silver gelatin prints.

**[Read the Latent Whitepaper](./projects/LATENT.md)**

#### Hardware
A blockchain artwork interrogating authenticity and provenance through AI-generated hyper-realistic renderings of traditional authentication systems.
